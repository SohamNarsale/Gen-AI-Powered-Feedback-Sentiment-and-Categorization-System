Here\\'s a simple example using a common scheme for customer feedback: Positive, Neutral, Negative, and Suggestion. I\\'ll provide examples of how to classify various observations based on this scheme.\\n\\n1. **Observation:** \"I loved the new app design. It\\'s so much easier to use now.\"\\n   - **Classification:** Positive\\n   - **Reason:** The customer expresses satisfaction and praise for the new design.\\n\\n2. **Observation:** \"The product is okay, but I expected more features.\"\\n   - **Classification:** Neutral\\n   - **Reason:** The customer is neither fully satisfied nor dissatisfied but has some reservations.\\n\\n3. **Observation:** \"The customer service was terrible. I waited for hours and got no help.\"\\n   - **Classification:** Negative\\n   - **Reason:** The customer expresses dissatisfaction and frustration with the service.\\n\\n4. **Observation:** \"It would be great if you could add a dark mode to the app.\"\\n   - **Classification:** Suggestion\\n   - **Reason:** The customer is providing a specific suggestion for improvement.\\n\\n5. **Observation:** \"The delivery was on time, and the product was as described.\"\\n   - **Classification:** Positive\\n   - **Reason:** The customer is satisfied with the service and product.\\n\\n6. **Observation:** \"The website is functional, but it could use some improvements in the user interface.\"\\n   - **Classification:** Neutral\\n   - **Reason:** The customer acknowledges functionality but also points out areas for improvement.\\n\\n7. **Observation:** \"I\\'m very disappointed with the quality of the product. It broke after just a few uses.\"\\n   - **Classification:** Negative\\n   - **Reason:** The customer expresses strong dissatisfaction with the product quality.\\n\\n8. **Observation:** \"Could you please add more payment options? It would make the checkout process smoother.\"\\n   - **Classification:** Suggestion\\n   - **Reason:** The customer is providing a specific suggestion for improvement.\\n\\n9. **Observation:** \"The app is fantastic!
